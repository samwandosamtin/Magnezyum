This should fix the issue with the \"Vazgeç\" button.\n\nI've also moved the selection of the form and its elements outside of the form's submit event listener. This should fix the issue with not being able to write anything in the form.In this code, I've added a separate event listener for the \"Vazgeç\" button (cancelButton). When this button is clicked, the form's action is set to 'add', the text of the \"Add\" button is set to 'Add Note', the \"Vazgeç\" button is hidden, and the inputs are cleared. This should fix the issue with the \"Vazgeç\" button.\n\nI've also moved the selection of the form and its elements outside of the form's submit event listener.
